# Course Catalog Full Stack JS App
 **Full Stack React App**

## Description:
This app links to a school course database.  It allows the user to view, create, update, and delete courses.  Authorized users can update and delete their own courses.  Users who don't have an account can sign up by providing their first and last name, email, and password.

## Getting the project up and running:

 1. Download the Zip file and extract its contents.
 2. Open the api folder and client folder in a text editor in seperate windows.
 3. Install the dependencies for the api and client in their respective terminals:

```
npm install
```

 4. Start the api and client:

```
npm start
```

## Notes
 1. Unauthorized users for courses not belonging to them will not have the "Delete" or "Update" buttons visible to them.
 
 ## How I worked on this project
My goal was to simulate a professional work environment.
- I built this app based mockup images.
## How to navigate this project
- The application uses a REST API to connect to a database and fetch and post data.
## Why I built the project this way
- This was the combination of two projects, building a REST API and the front end to connect to the API with React.js.
## If I had more time I would change this
- Refactor the code using React Router 6.
## Available Scripts
